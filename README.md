Quick example:

```javascript
var soundbox = new SoundBox();
soundbox.load("beep-a", "beep-a.wav")
    .then(
        () => console.log("Loaded beep a!"),
        () => console.error("Failed to load keep a :-(")
    );
soundbox.load("beep-b", "beep-b.wav");
soundbox.load("beep-c", "beep-c.wav");
soundbox.load("victory", "victory.mp3");

soundbox.play("beep-a")
    .then(() => soundbox.play("beep-b"))
    .then(() => soundbox.play("beep-c"))
    .then(() => soundbox.play("victory"));
    
// The 3rd parameter is the volume: The callback can be omitted to enable promise mode
soundbox.play("beep", null, 0.8)
    .then(() => soundbox.play("victory"))
```

## Download
The recommended way to obtain soundbox is via [npm](https://npmjs.org/) here: [sound-box](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sound-box) - To install it simply type `npm install sound-box`. Then you can include any of the 4 files described below from the `./node_modules/sound-box/` directory.

If npm isn't for you, then the latest master should be perfectly stable. If you want something that you know will work, try the latest [release](https://github.com/sbrl/soundbox/releases).

The following files are available via all release methods:
 * [soundbox.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.js) - The main development version.
 * [soundbox.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.min.js) - A minified version of the above.
 * [soundbox.jsm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.jsm) - An ES6 module-compatible version that's autogenerated. If you possibly can, I'd advise learning about about them. [This is a useful resource](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/).
 * [soundbox.jsm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.min.jsm) - A minified version of the above.


## Usage

### Create a new instance:

```javascript
var soundbox = new SoundBox();
```

### Load a sound
Sound loading is done as follows. If a callback is not specified, promise mode is activated.

```javascript
// Promise mode
soundbox.load("alias", "path/to/filename").then(
    () => console.log("Loaded beep!"),
    () => console.error("Failed to load beep :-(")
);
soundbox.load("victory", "./sounds/yay.wav").then( /* .... */);
```

```javascript
// Callback mode
soundbox.load("alias", "path/to/filename", function() {
    console.log("Loaded beep!");
});
```

### Play a sound
Similarly, playing a sound takes 2 forms: callback and promise.

```javascript
// Promise mode
soundbox.play("beep-a")
    .then(() => soundbox.play("beep-b")) /* The .then() is optional of course */
    .then(() => soundbox.play("beep-c"))
    .then(() => soundbox.play("victory"));
```

```javascript
// Callback mode
soundbox.play("beep", function() {
	// Do stuff
});
```

#### Specify the volume
The volume can be specified when playing a sound, too. The volume should be a floating-point number between 0 (silent) and 1 (full volume, default).

Here's how:

```javascript
// Promise mode
soundbox.play("beep-a", null, 0.8)
    .then(() => /* .... */);
```

```javascript
// Callback mode
soundbox.play("beep", function() {
	// Do stuff
}, 0.5);
```

### Specify the default volume
If you'd like to change the default volume that sounds are played at, do this:

```javascript
soundbox.default_volume = 0.45; // Sets the default volume to 45%
```

#### Looping again and again
As of v0.3.7, looping support has been added. Use it like this:

```javascript
// Promise mode
soundbox.play("rocket", null, 0.8, true)
    .then(() => /* .... */);
```

```javascript
// Callback mode
soundbox.play("rocket", function() {
	// Do stuff
}, null, true); // A null volume = use the default volume. Supported in both modes of operation
```

### Stop all sounds
You can stop all currently playing sounds like this:

```javascript
soundbox.stop_all();
```

### Unload a sound
If you want to, you can unload a sound:

```javascript
soundbox.remove("sound_alias");
soundbox.remove("oops");
```

### Get the current version
Get the current version of SoundBox:

```javascript
console.log(`Soundbox is at ${SoundBox.version}`);
```

 - **v0.3.1:** Added non-es6 version and build system to automate minification.
 - **v0.3.2:** Added `.stop_all()` and `default_volume`
 - **v0.3.3:** Fix a bug in `.stop_all()`
 - **v0.3.4:** Fix another bug in `.stop_all()`
